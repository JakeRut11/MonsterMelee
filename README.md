# MonsterMelee
2020 AP Computer Science A Final Project. A game about monsters fighting monsters in turn-based combat.

Monster Melee is a simple fighting game demo that I built as a final project during my senior year of high school. The game is similar to that of the Pokemon franchise, with basic, turn-based combat. The game includes six main fighters and a hidden fighter as well, and the attacks depend heavily on random generation.

All of the images in the game are of my own creation, though not all of the music is created by me, though they are taken from open source/parody sound sources.
