# MonsterMelee
2020 AP Computer Science A Final Project. A game about monsters fighting monsters in turn-based combat.

Monster Melee is a simple fighting game demo that I built as a final project during my senior year of high school. The game is similar to that of the Pokemon franchise, with basic, turn-based combat. The game includes six main fighters and a hidden fighter as well, and the attacks depend heavily on random generation.
